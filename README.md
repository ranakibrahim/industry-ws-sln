### Introduction
Our Industry Project ðŸ”¥/product name/ is a financial learning tool created for Wealthsimple, one of BrainStation's Industry Partners. This product was researched, designed, and produced during a 24-hour collaborative tech sprint from 30 May - 31 May 2024.

Our team consisted of 5 software engineering students:
- Lily Chen
- Rana Ibrahim

- Carly Wilk
- Praise Yu

### Problem Space
How might we help Wealthsimple clients in Canada to improve their financial literacy and make better personal finance decisions?

### User & Market Research


### Our Solution
ðŸ”¥/product name/ was imagined with the user experience as a priority; how could we as developers create a space in which financial learning was continuous and accessible. Our solution utilizes user input in order to generate personalized recommendations and learning materials sourced from the Wealthsimple website. The quiz uses a number of questions to determine where in their financial journey the user sits, taking into consideration their short-term and long-term goals when computing a result. 
We categorized the materials available on Weathsimple's site into seven groups based on if the user was just beginning their financial journey, or looking for more in depth knowledge to aid in portfolio growth (see below). 

1. Beginning Your Journey
2. Implementing Habits
3. Learning to Save
4. Paying Your Taxes
5. Big Purchases
6. Growing Your Money
7. Digital Currency

Different quiz endpoints will result depending on how the user answers the questions. 

ðŸ”¥/product name/ continues to provide the user with educational resources to guide them and further clarify their saving priorities. If the user is looking to move in a different direction with their finances, the quiz can be completed again with these new considerations in mind. /product name/ then leverages the users past goals and new priorities to source different learning materials that align with their future goals.  

### Demonstration
Our demonstration guides you through the application from UserName's perspective, a 22-year old university graduate who is now transition into their career (<- ðŸ”¥update this to the correct info once I have it). 
As the user provides details on their financial situation, /product name/ is able to determine which stage the user is positioned. The result of the quiz categorizes the user into one of the several groups listed above and then educates the user accordingly.

On the homepage of the users Wealthsimple account there will be two resources updated weekly. The user can click on these buttons and be redirected to educational materials found on the Wealthsimple website. 
The number of resources presented within the financial dashboard was limited as we are looking to help build the habit of continuous growth and learning.
