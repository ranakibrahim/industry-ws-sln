### Introduction
Our Industry Project ðŸ”¥/product name/ is a financial learning tool created for Wealthsimple, one of BrainStation's Industry Partners. This product was researched, designed, and produced during a 24-hour collaborative tech sprint from 30 May - 31 May 2024.

How might we help Wealthsimple clients in Canada to improve their financial literacy and make better personal finance decisions?


### User & Market Research
ðŸ”¥(to be added)


### Our Solution
ðŸ”¥/product name/ was imagined with user experience as the priority; how could we as developers create a space in which financial learning was continuous and accessible?

Our solution utilizes user input in order to generate personalized recommendations and learning materials sourced from the Wealthsimple website. The quiz uses a number of questions to determine where in their financial journey the user is situated, taking into consideration their short-term and long-term goals when computing a result. 

We categorized the materials available on Weathsimple's site into seven groups based on if the user was just beginning their financial journey, or looking for more in depth knowledge to aid in portfolio growth (see below). 

1. Beginning Your Journey
2. Implementing Habits
3. Learning to Save
4. Paying Your Taxes
5. Big Purchases
6. Growing Your Money
7. Digital Currency

Different quiz endpoints will return depending on how the user answers the questions. 

After quiz completion, ðŸ”¥/product name/ continues to provide the user with educational resources in order to guide them and further clarify their saving priorities. If the user is looking to move in a different direction with their finances, the quiz can be completed again with these new considerations in mind. ðŸ”¥/product name/ then leverages the users past goals and new priorities to source different learning materials that align with their future goals.  


### Demonstration
Our demonstration guides you through the application from UserName's perspective, a 22-year old university graduate who is beginning the transition to career (<- ðŸ”¥update this to the correct info once I have it). 

As the user provides details on their financial situation, ðŸ”¥/product name/ is able to determine at which stage the user is positioned. The result of the quiz categorizes the user into one of the several groups and then returns learning resources to the user accordingly. 

ðŸ”¥(figma mockups here)

On landing at the user's Wealthsimple account there will be two clickable cards that directs the user to two different learning pages, updated weekly. 

The number of resources presented to the user is not static; we are looking to build a product that guides the user along their financial journey, growing and moving with them.


### Key Insights
ðŸ”¥(to be added)


### Possible Growth & Future Directions
A notification system where users receive pings related to their learning journey in financial literacy. These notifications aim to encourage and prompt users to continue their progress by reminding them of their achievements so far and suggesting additional resources for further learning.

Implementing a page within the navigation bar that directs the user to a list of all learning materials related to their journey. A progress bar will indicate to the user how much learning they have completed and encourage the user to continue with their lessons. Resources that have been reviewed will relocate to the bottom of the list and be greyed out to indicate their completion. 

Chatbot functionality that when the user asks various questions about their financial status, the bot will return related updates and encouragements. For example, the user could ask the chatbot how their investments are performing, if they are on track with their budget, or if they could recommend further reading regarding a specific topic.
